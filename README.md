My Submission for the Deno Advent of Code challenge!
https://deno.com/blog/advent-of-code-2024

I've never used deno, but was excited to try it out after the 2.0 release. I started the project by using deno init and then am running all scripts using deno:
deno run --allow-read SCRIPT_DAY/PART_FILE

It's not much since I don't have any tests or external packages, but it's been a nice intro into deno and I especially appreciate the native typescript support.

I haven't added any tests or anything, so I've just been using deno as the runtime and to access files, but have also been working on a benchmarking project here: https://github.com/sigmaSd/Aoc2024Bench, which is deployed on deno.dev.
